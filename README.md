## Project Overview

This repository contains my MSc coursework project for the Understanding Artificial Intelligence module.

The project focuses on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to structured datasets, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and result interpretation.

### Main Tasks

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Implementation of supervised learning models  
- Model evaluation using performance metrics  
- Visualisation of key insights  
- Interpretation of AI model results  

---

## Structure

- `jupyternotebooks/` – project notebooks  
- `image plots/` – exported plots used in the analysis  

---

## Files

### Notebooks

- `Component One.ipynb`  
- `Component Two.ipynb`  

These notebooks contain the full implementation, analysis, modelling, and evaluation processes.

### Image Plots

The `image plots/` folder contains exported visualisations generated during analysis, including:

- `age_hist_binwidth5.png` – Age distribution with 5-year bins  
- `dependants_hist.png` – Distribution of number of dependants  
- `age_by_marital_status.png` – Age distribution by marital status  
- `distance_salary_scatter.png` – Commuted distance vs salary  
- `age_salary_scatter.png` – Age vs salary  
- `age_salary_dependants_scatter.png` – Age vs salary coloured by dependants

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
